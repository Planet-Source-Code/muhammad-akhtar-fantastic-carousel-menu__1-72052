Hi fellows..
to set icons, edit labels and action command
follow me....
go to the icons folder and edit icons.xml

Example: <thumbnail filename="Products.png" label="Manage Products" url="Products" />
	Icons you want to set goes here thumbnail filename="youricon.png"
	label="Hi your mouse is over me"
	url="Hi you clicked me"

I am here at planet source code from last 6 years and really this site rocks, either you are here to 
learn or share.

Hope you guys like it and use it but dont forget to vote..
thanks in advance
